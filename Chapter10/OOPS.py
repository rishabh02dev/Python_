# programming is mainly of two types

# 2.Procedural oriented programming

# implementing the sum of two numbers by normal approach

a = 12
b = 36
print("The sum of a and b is ", a+b)

# and now solving through 
# OOPS

# EmployeeName -->Pascal case

# camel case
# isNumerice , isFloat ,isFloatOrInt --> Camel Case
